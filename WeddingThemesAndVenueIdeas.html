   <h1 style="text-align:center"> Rustic Romance </h1>
   <p>    </p>
  
  <h2>  Is This Venue/Theme Right For Me? </h2>
  <p>If being in the country is your happy place, then this is for you! Rustic weddings feature many wooden designs with accents <br>
    of lace and burlap. Since the reception parties usually take place in a remodeled barn, a small to medium wedding would be ideal. </p>
 
  <h2> What To Keep In Mind </h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Although some wedding planners dub this as a "low-cost" wedding, you will have to rent <br>
     the chairs, tables, boothes, and other equipment that venues usually have which could be expensive.</li>
    <li>Many barns offer options to host the ceremony indoors in case of inclement weather.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>  Is This Venue/Theme Right For Me? </h2>
  <p>If you can't get enough of the salty breeze and cool sand between your toes, then head down to the beach for your wedding.<br>
  Ceremonies held here are usually budget friendly.</p> 
 
  <h2> What To Keep In Mind </h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Tell guests to bring flip flops to not ruin their shoes in the sand</li>
    <li>Remember to bring sunscreen</li>
    <li>There could be strong gusts of wind</li>
    <li>Seagulls could get too close to the ceremony</li>
  </ul>
  
  
     <h1 style="text-align:center"> Gorgeous Garden </h1>
   <p>    </p>
  
  <h2> Is This Venue/Theme Right For Me? </h2>
  <p>A garden wedding sounds like a dream come true for those that enjoy open green pastures surrounded by flowers and tree.<br>
  Garden weddings are flexible enough to include elaborate displays of foliage or be played down to a minimalistic design.</p> 
 
  <h2> What To keep In Mind </h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>The flowers could attract insects. Make sure to bring/ provide bug spray.</li>
    <li>Since there is already flowers around the venue, this will reduce costs when booking a florist</li>
  </ul>
